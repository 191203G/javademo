This Project is building the backend for an e-commerce website, here is the project outline.

Project Overview: E-commerce Website Backend
Objective: Develop a backend system for an e-commerce platform that handles product management, customer accounts, shopping carts, orders, and payment processing.

Step 1: Define the Requirements

Product Management:
Add, update, and remove products.
Manage product categories and inventory.
Search and filter products.
User Management:
User registration and authentication.
Profile management.
Password recovery.
Shopping Cart and Order Management:
Add, update, and remove items in a cart.
Checkout process that transitions a cart to an order.
View order history.
Payment Integration:
Integration with a mock payment gateway for processing payments.
Support for different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

Step 2: Technologies

Spring Boot: This will be the core framework for creating the REST API.
Spring Data JPA: For data access layers, simplifying database interactions.
WAMP MySQL: As the relational database to store user data, product information, orders, etc.
Gradle
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication.
Spring Security: For securing the API.

Step 3: API Design
Design REST API endpoints. Hereâ€™s a simple draft of what some of these might look like:

POST /api/users/register - Registers a new user.
POST /api/users/login - Authenticates a user.
GET /api/products - Retrieves all products or searches for products by parameters.
POST /api/products - Adds a new product (admin only).
PUT /api/products/{id} - Updates product details (admin only).
DELETE /api/products/{id} - Deletes a product (admin only).
POST /api/cart - Adds an item to the cart.
GET /api/cart - Gets all items in the cart.
DELETE /api/cart/{itemId} - Removes an item from the cart.
POST /api/orders - Creates a new order from the cart.
GET /api/orders - Gets the user's order history.

Step 4: Setup Development Environment
Install Java 17.
For this project I'm using Visual Studio Codes.
Install Wamp MySQL and set up database.
Install Gradle

Step 5: Start Coding
Begin by setting up your project structure with Spring Initializr.
Implement the database models using Spring Data JPA entities.
Develop the repositories and services for handling business logic.
Implement the controllers for your API endpoints.

Step 6: Testing
Write unit tests for your services using JUnit and Mockito.
Test API endpoints with Postman or any other API testing tool.

Step 7: Documentation
Document your API endpoints with Swagger or Spring REST Docs.
This project will not only enhance your backend skills but also give you a significant project to discuss during job interviews.

Step 1: Define Database Models
Begin by defining your database models. These are the JPA entities that will represent your tables in the MySQL database.

Product: Represents items for sale.
Attributes: id, name, description, price, stock quantity, category.
User: Represents customers and possibly admins.
Attributes: id, username, password, email, role.
Order: Represents a completed purchase.
Attributes: id, user, order date, total amount, status.
OrderItem: Represents items within an order.
Attributes: id, order, product, quantity, price.
Cart: Temporary storage for items a user intends to purchase.
Attributes: id, user.
CartItem: Represents items within the cart.
Attributes: id, cart, product, quantity.
Step 2: Set Up Database Access Layer
Use Spring Data JPA to create repositories for accessing and manipulating the database.

Repository for each entity: For example, ProductRepository, UserRepository, etc.
Step 3: Develop Business Logic
Create service classes that handle business logic.

ProductService: Methods to add, remove, update, and fetch products.
UserService: Methods for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
OrderService: Methods to create orders from carts, update order status, and view order history.
CartService: Methods to add, remove, and update items in the cart.
Step 4: Implement API Endpoints
Define controllers that handle API requests and interact with your services.

ProductController: Endpoints for product management (CRUD operations).
UserController: Endpoints for user registration, login, and profile updates.
OrderController: Endpoints to manage orders.
CartController: Endpoints for shopping cart management.
Step 5: Secure the API
Configure Spring Security to secure your endpoints, using basic authentication or JWT for managing sessions and securing sensitive operations.
